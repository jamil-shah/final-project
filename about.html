            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey, I’m Jamil Shah. Born in Kabul, Afghanistan, I moved to the United States with my family when I was five. East Lansing, Michigan has been home for the last 17 years, so I guess you could say I’m pretty settled here.</p>
            
            <p>I started my college life at the University of Michigan-Flint but transferred to Michigan State University after my freshman year—thanks to Covid-19 and the move back to East Lansing. It’s been a smooth ride since then, and I’m getting the best of what MSU has to offer.</p>
            
            <p>I've always had a knack for cybersecurity. It’s like solving a never-ending puzzle that keeps getting more complicated. My classes at MSU, like IT Network Management and Applied Programming, have been pretty engaging. I also worked as a Research Lab Assistant, diving into data analysis on public sentiment towards ChatGPT. Fun stuff if you’re into that kind of thing.</p>
            
            <p>Currently, I work part-time as a Student Assistant at the Energy Center for the Department of Technology, Management, and Budget at the State of Michigan. The Energy Center is basically a power plant, and I handle emissions reports and other IT-related tasks. It’s a good gig that keeps me busy and pays the bills.</p>
            
            <p>When I’m not working or studying, I like to lift weights and play Dota 2. Lifting is a good way to stay fit, and Dota 2 keeps my mind sharp with all its strategies. It’s a nice balance between physical activity and mental relaxation.</p>
            
            <p>So yeah, that’s a bit about me. I’m into cybersecurity, doing my bit at the Energy Center, and finding time for some lifting and gaming in between.</p>
